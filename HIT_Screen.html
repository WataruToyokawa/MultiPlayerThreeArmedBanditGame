    <p class="lead">
        This HIT is one of a series of our decision-making studies (named <span class="note">Lottery Choice Experiment (fun + bonus!)</span>).<br />
        If you have already participated in the past, please do <span class="note">NOT</span> accept this HIT.

    <h2>In this HIT:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You will participate with other participants in an interactive economic decision-making experiment. Because we would like for many participants to take part at the same time, you may have to wait for up to 5 minutes to begin the task. You will be paid for the amount of time you wait.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the decision making task is complete, there is a short survey. This survey is optional, but provides useful data about who participate in this experiment. All results are anonymous, and confidential.
        </li>
    </ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Extra Bonus:</h2>
    <p>
        After you complete both tasks and submit this HIT, you will be paid 25 cents for your participation and reading instruction plus any extra bonus you earn. In addition, you will receive 12 cents per minute ($7.2 an hour) for any time spent in the waiting room.
